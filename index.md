## Designs and code

I'll post information on my designs and code here, especially on projects which I've released as open-source on github.

### Ongoing projects

Below are a few of the projects which I've recently moved to github. In the coming weeks I intend to continue clean up and
refactor some of my code into separate projects which I'll make available in the hope that they are useful to others. I'll
spend some time documenting everything eventually.

#### Base

A collection of data structures, algorithms and utility functions used by my other projects. 
[Go to the Base project repo](https://github.com/vikashmadhow/base)

#### Long term serialization

A library for serializing (and deserializing) Java object graphs to various text formats such 
as XML, JSON and YAML, useful for long-term storage with a focus on human readability and external modification.
